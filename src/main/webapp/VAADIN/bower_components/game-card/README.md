[![Published on webcomponents.org](https://img.shields.io/badge/webcomponents.org-published-blue.svg)](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/vpusher/game-card)

üÉè Playing game card custom element based on **ES6** and **Polymer 2.0**.

This aims to act as a project sample taking advantage of native [Shadow DOM v1](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/shadowdom/) 
and [Custom Elements v1](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/customelements/) APIs.

Features:

* Flippable with 3D CSS.
* Infinitely scalable thanks to unicode characters and SVG.

Example:
<!---
```
<custom-element-demo>
  <template>
    <script src="../webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-lite.js"></script>
    <link rel="import" href="game-card.html">
    <next-code-block></next-code-block>
  </template>
</custom-element-demo>
```
-->
```html
<game-card symbol="‚ô†" rank="a"></game-card>
<game-card symbol="‚ô•" rank="3" unrevealed></game-card>
<game-card symbol="‚ô£" rank="9"></game-card>
<game-card symbol="‚ô¶" rank="k"></game-card>
